There are two ways to use pakket. If you are running this as a phar use the .phar file name as your command.

For the purposes of clarity this text will use ./pakket.phar as the command line tool.
But you might be running it from the vendor directory in which case it may be vendor/bin/pakket

Make sure you have a pakket.json file in your project directory and run the following :

./pakket.phar path/to/your/project/dir path/to/target.phar

The target phar file name is optional, if you created a pakket.json file in that directory.
But if you specify it. That filename will be used instead of the one in pakket.json (handy for automated systems)

For syntax on pakket.json see the README.MD or run :

./pakket.phar readme
